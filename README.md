# Features

- The kernel exploit is somewhat relible, works about 2/3 times without panic or reboot
- Dropbear ssh included on port 2222
- Uses ellekit for tweak injection.
- Packs Zebra and sileo by default. Cydia cannot be fixed for iOS 18. It's dead.

# WARNING

- Messing around with the untether may BOOTLOOP your device, do not.

# Building and Running

Requirements:
- You need a supported device running a supported iOS version (see above)
- The device must be connected via USB
- You need the IPSW for your device, *unzipped*
- You need to have Xcode installed
- You need to have iproxy and ideviceinstaller installed (brew install usbmuxd ideviceinstaller)

To build and run the iOS Jailbreak, all you have to do is run the `ios_install.py` script and follow the instructions.
In case you get a code signing error, open `arm/iOS/Fugu14App/Fugu14App.xcodeproj` and edit the code signing options.

# Recovery

So you didn't read the warning section and your device is now in a bootloop. Let's hope you didn't enable the fast untether.  
Anyway, before updating your device to the latest iOS version, try the following first:

1. Install irecovery on your computer
2. Connect your device via USB and boot into the recovery mode
3. Run `irecovery -s` on your computer, then enter the following commands:
- setenv boot-args no_untether
- saveenv
- reboot
4. Your device should now boot again. If it doesn't, repeat step two again, run `irecovery -s` and then enter these commands:
- setenv boot-args untether_force_restore
- saveenv
- reboot
5. Device still won't boot? Then you'll have to update it to the latest version unfortunately :/

# Credits

Like most software, Fugu14 contains (derived) code which was written by others.  
I would therefore like to thank the people below for open-sourcing their code:

- [Samuel Gro√ü](https://twitter.com/5aelo): SLOP technique (as used in the dyld exploit) and the JavaScript Int64 library (+ utils)

Currently, the remount patch has copyright issues which I'm trying to resolve ASAP. Apparently, multiple parties think the code is theirs so I don't know what to do right now. I just write this here and hope no one DMCA's me.

Fugu18 also includes various header files from Apple.
